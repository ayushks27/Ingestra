Ingestra

Ingestra is an end-to-end data ingestion and processing pipeline designed to transform raw, large-scale review data into analytics-ready datasets, enabling efficient querying and visualization through a lightweight application layer.

Project Overview

- Batch ingestion of large datasets (1+ GB) using chunked processing
- Schema normalization and data cleaning
- Relational data modeling using SQLite
- Separation of ingestion, storage, and consumption layers
- Interactive analytics via a Streamlit-based UI

The project focuses on scalability, reproducibility, and clean architecture, following real-world data engineering best practices.

Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, sqlite3)
- SQLite (analytical storage)
- Streamlit (data visualization & UI)
- scikit-learn (text feature extraction & modeling)
- Git (version control)

Data Model

business(Dimension Table)

    Column	         Description
    b_id	         Unique business identifier
    name	         Business name
    postal_code	     Zip code

predicted_reviews (Fact Table)

    Column	                Description
    business_id	            Foreign key to business table
    Review	                Review text
    Stars	                Rating score
    True(1)/Deceptive(0)	Review authenticity label

Setup & Installation

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ingestra.git
    cd ingestra

Create and activate environment

    conda create -n ingestra python=3.10
    conda activate ingestra
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Ingestion Workflow

Step 1: Initialize the database
Creates schema and loads business metadata.

    python Scripts/setup_database.py

Step 2: Ingest large review dataset
Processes large CSV files using chunked ingestion to avoid memory issues.

    python Scripts/ingest_predicted_reviews.py

This script is designed to handle datasets >1 GB efficiently.

Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit UI: 

    streamlit run Scripts/UI.py

Then open:

    http://localhost:8501

UI Features

- Input business name and zipcode
- Compute fake review ratio
- Analyze key phrases influencing ratings
- Visualize insights interactively

Key Engineering Decisions

- Chunked ingestion to handle large datasets safely
- Schema normalization before loading into the database
- Database-backed querying instead of loading raw files in the UI
- Separation of concerns between ingestion, storage, and visualization

Reproducible pipelines over committing raw data

Deployment

- The Streamlit application is deployed using a lightweight demo database for visualization.
- Large-scale ingestion and full datasets are intentionally excluded from deployment and are handled via local or cloud-based ingestion pipelines.

🔗 **Live App**: https://ingestra-r2kg3ympsfqguhundbbyod.streamlit.app/#ingestra

Demo Inputs

    - **Zipcode:** `226021`
    - **Restaurant:** `Demo Cafe`

Demo Notes

- The demo uses a **small, curated SQLite database (`yelp_demo.db`)**
- Heavy ingestion and model training pipelines are intentionally excluded from deployment
- This ensures fast startup, reproducibility, and stable execution in a cloud environment

Known Demo Limitations

- The demo dataset is intentionally small
- Phrase-level ML analysis is skipped when data is insufficient
- This behavior is **by design** and mirrors production-grade guardrails

The full ingestion, cleaning, and model-training pipelines are available in the repository
for local execution and architectural reference.

What This Project Demonstrates

- Real-world data ingestion patterns
- Handling of large datasets with limited memory
- Clean relational modeling for analytics
- Transition from notebooks to production scripts
- End-to-end ownership of a data pipeline

Future Improvements

- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL / Redshift
- Add data quality checks & logging
- Introduce orchestration (Airflow)
- Add automated tests for ingestion scripts
- Support cloud storage (S3-style ingestion)
